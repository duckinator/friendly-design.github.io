Friendly design is an interface design style aiming for minimalism, but
explicitly prioritizing accessibility and understandability.
A significant part of this is explicitly adding design details in areas
for purposes of disambiguation and following guidelines related to
accessibility and usability, such as those from the
[Web Accessibility Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Initiative)
(WAI).

## Comparison to flat design

Friendly design is related to flat design. I recommend reading
[the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design) as well as
[The Next Web's article discussing flat design](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/03/19/history-flat-design-efficiency-minimalism-made-digital-world-flat/).

From The Next Web's article:

_"In laymenâ€™s terms, this means removing stylistic characters such as drop shadows, gradients, textures, and any other type of design that is meant to make the element feel three-dimensional."_

## Key Differences

The key differences between flat design and friendly design are that
friendly design:

* Emphasizes understandability of an interface over minimalism.
* Follows applicable accessibility and usability standards and guidelines,

Throughout the rest of this document, I'll further expand on these points.

## Following Accessibility and Usability Standards and Guidelines

All interfaces, not just websites, should follow applicable
[Web Accessibility Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Initiative)
standards and guidelines, including the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines)
(WCAG).

## Common Design Failures, And How To Avoid Them

An extremely common failure when using flat design is having insufficient
contrast between text and background colors. To that end, interfaces
should follow the
[WCAG 2.0 guidelines for use of color (1.4.1) and contrast (1.4.3)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#visual-audio-contrast).
You can use
[Lea Verou's contrast ratio checker](https://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)
for checking compliance with the latter.

This means is that wherever color is used to convey something to
the user, something else should be used as well &mdash; e.g.,
underlining links or outlining buttons a certain way.
This ensures interfaces make sense to as many people as possible.

A related common failure of interfaces is simplifying the design to
the point that users can't differentiate between elements.
E.g., giving buttons and text inputs the same styling: a border, and
nothing else. This should be avoided to the extent it is possible.

Meeting the WCAG 2.0 guidelines for contrast ensures the readability
of the interface.
