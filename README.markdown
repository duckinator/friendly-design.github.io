# Friendly Design

Friendly design is an interface design style taking cues from flat design, but
explicitly adding more detail in areas for purposes of disambiguation and
following guidelines related to accessibility and usability, such as those from
the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Initiative)
(WAI).

As this is meant to be an augmentation of, as opposed to a replacement for,
flat design, this document will discuss it in relation to flat design.

## What is flat design?

First, let's establish what I mean by flat design. To do this, I recommend
reading [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design) as well as [The Next Web's article discussing it](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/03/19/history-flat-design-efficiency-minimalism-made-digital-world-flat/).

From The Next Web's article:

"In laymenâ€™s terms, this means removing stylistic characters such as drop shadows, gradients, textures, and any other type of design that is meant to make the element feel three-dimensional."

## Key Differences

The key differences between flat design and friendly design are that friendly
design explicitly:

* Follows applicable accessibility and usability standards and guidelines,
* Emphasizes understandability of an interface over minimalism.

Throughout the rest of this document, I will further expand on these points.

## Common Failures When Using Flat Design

[WIP]

An extremely common failure when using flat design is having insufficient
contrast between text and background colors. To that end, all color text and
background color combinations in interfaces should pass at least AA level for
WCAG 2.0 contrast ratio ... https://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/

Another common failure of interfaces following flat design principles is simplifying
things to the point that you can't differentiate between elements on the page
&mdash; e.g., buttons which are indistinguishable from a textarea with text in
it which are indistinguishable from a mere section of content with a different
background color.

The failures are more with the interpretations of flat design than of flat design itself.

* Low-contrast text
* Buttons that don't look like buttons
* UI elements that can't be identified
* ...

## Following Accessibility and Usability Standards and Guidelines

[WIP]

Websites should follow applicable [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Initiative)
standards and guidelines, including the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines)
(WCAG).
