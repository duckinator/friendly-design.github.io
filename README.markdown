# Friendly Design

Friendly design is an interface design aiming for minimalism, but explicitly
prioritizing accessibility and understandability. A significant part of this is
explicitly adding design details in areas for purposes of disambiguations and
following guidelines related to accessibility and usability, such as those from
the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Initiative)
(WAI).

## Comparison to flat design

Friendly design is related to flat design. I recommend reading
[the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design) as well as
[The Next Web's article discussing flat design](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/03/19/history-flat-design-efficiency-minimalism-made-digital-world-flat/).

From The Next Web's article:

"In laymenâ€™s terms, this means removing stylistic characters such as drop shadows, gradients, textures, and any other type of design that is meant to make the element feel three-dimensional."

## Key Differences

The key differences between flat design and friendly design are that friendly
design:

* Emphasizes understandability of an interface over minimalism.
* Follows applicable accessibility and usability standards and guidelines,

Throughout the rest of this document, I will further expand on these points.

## Common Failures When Using Flat Design

An extremely common failure when using flat design is having insufficient
contrast between text and background colors. To that end, interfaces should
follow the [WCAG 2.0 guidelines for use of color (1.4.1) and contrast (1.4.3)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#visual-audio-contrast). You can use [Lea Verou's contrast ratio checker](https://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/)
for checking compliance with the latter.

Another common failure of interfaces is simplifying a design to the point that
users can't differentiate between elements on the page &mdash; e.g., buttons
which are indistinguishable from a textarea with text in it, which themselves
are indistinguishable from a mere section of content with a different background
color.

[WIP]

The failures are more with the interpretations of flat design than of flat design itself.

* Low-contrast text
* Buttons that don't look like buttons
* UI elements that can't be identified
* ...

## Following Accessibility and Usability Standards and Guidelines

[WIP]

Websites should follow applicable [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Initiative)
standards and guidelines, including the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines)
(WCAG).
