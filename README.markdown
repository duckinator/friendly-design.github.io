# Friendly Design

Friendly design is an interface design style taking cues from flat design, but
explicitly adding more detail in areas for purposes of disambiguation and
following guidelines related to accessibility and usability, such as those from
the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Initiative)
(WAI).
